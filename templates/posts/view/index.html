An event ticketing system streamlines the process by offering functionalities to sell and manage the ticketing process smoothly. The good thing with new ticket selling platforms is that you don't necessarily have to be a tech-savvy person, in fact, no technical knowledge is required whatsoever to implement a ticketing system and start selling!</p>
